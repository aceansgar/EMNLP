The task of open domain semantic parsing is to construct a logical form
(e.g., lambda-calculus) for a natural language question. For simplicity, we
will focus on two types of questions, single-relation questions and
questions with CVT structures. Each question in the training set is
annotated with entities, the question type and the corresponding logical
form. For example, the question what is theme music on the killing?, can
be parsed into (lambda?x(mso:tv.program.theme song the killing ?x)).

Use Bayes to implement.
